"Hi iApps colleagues,
please find the feedback writer have on the lag that he experience during 12noon for gym booking.
had mentioned twice that we are monitoring but he is not accepting the response. Wonder if we receive such feedback regularly and if there is
anything we could do?",Booking
"Hi Jun Jie,

Thanks for the fast reply.
I further wish to point out that the system traffic is too overwhelming and

it took me 8 mins to actually go in a book a slot. Worst, as I wait and
refresh I see slots number getting smaller and smaller. This enhancement
you and Janice elaborated to me in the previous emails are just pure
nonsense.

I was expecting to have a smooth booking experience but this is really too
much. The government encourage Singaporean to exercise more but how to
exercise more when your system don't allow me to book the gym slot?

I don't know to count myself extremely lucky or what, as I waited for YOUR
system to load I manage to book the 2nd last slot for 7pm. My group of
friends not so lucky.

Please get your team to look into this issue as I'm not the only one not
being satisfied with this server issue of yours. ""Monitoring"" is an
understatement as it had been days.

Looking forward to hearing from you.",Booking

"Hi Azimah

Under 11 Boys single will not show if it has reached maximum capacity.

Apologies, understand that the NRIC I provided is a U11 Boys and thus they cant see now becoz category is currently full.

But what had happened previously is that the father of this U11 boy had tried to register but he couldn’t see the singles category also when he tried to
register.

The registration was just open at then and we are 100% sure that registration is not full.

I have another NRIC – the daughter of the same father, to seek your assistance to check on: T1420020C",Competitions

Yes we know. We also know roughly the timing of captcha if it is slow or fast. Even we get in fast c1 3-5pm is taken already in bowen every saturday which is friday booking.
As you have take action on the previous issue in script booking. You have encourage the public to report. We just notice that it is weeks that c1 is always taken fast even thought we get in fast enough.
We hope you can just look into this and investigate if the booking is really human speed.
Thanks.

Hi,
Please be inform that booking is first come first serve and we do not have any control or allow reservation for individual booking. We have implemented Captcha our both App and Web platform during the peak hour at 7am ,12pm and 1pm.
With the CAPTCHA step, we are enhancing our autosystem to better serve all our members.
It is aimed at helping to prevent the use of automated software, which will mean that all members making any booking transactions on both the/   ActiveSG website and mobile app will have an equal chance.
Hope this clarifies.
Thank you.

Screenshot that c1 3-5 pm is booked already? I cannot capture it since we are booking 3-5 pm. But every week it is red already and not available.
Please help to check if this is prebooked or maybe using some script.
