"Hi All,

This case requires investigation

- Issue: Unable to register for child account on website, parental contact
does not appear - Platform: MMS, production

- Raised by: iAPPS HelpDesk, iAPPS

- How to get the problem again?

We had a call from a member who was unable to register for her 14 year old
son on the activesg website, they are unable to fill the parent/guardian
contact fields as it does not appear when selecting any month for the DOB.

They were using two different browsers and still had the same issue.

We have tested on our side and we have a similar issue as well.

When we select January, the parent/guardian contact fields do not appear
but when we select the other months, the fields appear.

We have advised the member to register through the mobile app instead.

Please kindly see attached for the differences

Please kindly advise, thank you.

Thanks and Best Regards,

Elizabeth",Account Profile,215416,

Able to assist as user called in trying to register a supplementary account for her daughter under the 'Add Child' function but is unable to do so due to the 'invalid ID' error prompt.  
The ID number is valid upon checking with NRIC checker and the child also does not have an existing ActiveSG account as we are unable to find the account in MMS.  
User was using the mobile app on her Android phone.

Good day Sir/Madam,

I’m writing pertaining to Active Sg account. I tried to login to my existing account but not able to, I
called Technical Support phone on 17-03-2021 at 0900hrs, they tried to reset my password but not
able to, the technical support team then direct me to Active Sg office at Hougang Sport Hall. At the
Sport Hall, the guest relation officer then ask me to reset the passwords, I follow her instruction
and reset the password 5 times but still not able to log in. We also tried using Singpass but also
can’t.

As my account had been inactive since 2017, and previously linked to the Facebook account, I
suspect the username is my facebook account. I had closed my facebook account since 2018. I
would like to request to delink my link facebook account and link to either my NRIC or handphone

My name is Karen Tay (9152 9929), I just made an online payment via activesg to sign up for my aikido classes @

I hope to find a solution to this problem and perhaps receive a refund.

Hi Azimah,
I went to Clementi sports hub last Saturday. The Active SG staff checked with
her pad and confirmed that my account has been verified. And she also
wondered why my $100 is not in my e-wallet, so she suggested me to send
email to ActiveSG.
Anyway I have tried to login via web browser, it is the same. Attached is the
screen shot.
Please advise.

Hi Ningsih,
Can you try to log in your ActiveSG via the web browser and try to verify your account from there?
Link to login via web browser : https://members.myactivesg.com/
Once you are log in, on the main page click on the ""X"" icon which is located beside your name, it will direct you to the Singpass login page.
Then log in using your Singpass NRIC and password..
Also ensure that you have set your e-wallet pin after you have verified your account again.
Do revert if issue still persist.

Hi Jun Jie,

Thanks for the fast reply.
I further wish to point out that the system traffic is too overwhelming and

it took me 8 mins to actually go in a book a slot. Worst, as I wait and
refresh I see slots number getting smaller and smaller. This enhancement
you and Janice elaborated to me in the previous emails are just pure
nonsense.

I was expecting to have a smooth booking experience but this is really too
much. The government encourage Singaporean to exercise more but how to
exercise more when your system don't allow me to book the gym slot?

I don't know to count myself extremely lucky or what, as I waited for YOUR
system to load I manage to book the 2nd last slot for 7pm. My group of
friends not so lucky.

Please get your team to look into this issue as I'm not the only one not
being satisfied with this server issue of yours. ""Monitoring"" is an
understatement as it had been days.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,
Christopher Leong Tai Hao

I expect this answer with no value.
Your booking is open at 7am means i can enter only at 7am.that is not the issue.
Before CB, we can enter to the slot chedule without any problem there i understand geting space is depend on people""s reaction at the
time of huge traffic for booking and few times we was told that slot selected was already selected.
But nowadays we even cant enter into the slot schedule. Always freeze or stick between the facility choosen and slot schedule chart.

Please note that 7.00am is the peak period due to high popularity of badminton court booking at ActiveSG.
Based on the timing stamped in the email, you attempted a booking at 7.00am which is the peak period where large number of people
rush in to book for badminton courts. The system processes multiple processes at a time which is why it takes a while to load.
We have escalated the issue to our developers for further investigation.
We seek your understanding that due to the complexity of the issue, it may take some time for it to be resolved.

Dear Sir/Mdm
I had an issue in booking badminton court for last 4-5 months,
1) After circuit breaker, i understand only sports hall where open, School halls are not open. so it was justified get booking on 7am had a
issue due to less availability.
2) But when school hall starts to open on Dec holidays i expected it would be back to normal like before circuit breaker.But it did not
happen to my wonder.
3) The main issue is when at 7am we sign in to book and when we choose the sports hall the apps where is was stuck there by showing
rolling(processing). After 2 minutes only it was allow us to go into the schedule where it was almost full. How others can go in and book
??.Why we are blocked/kept hold like this?? i tried through the website also the result is same.
4) Before Covid we can enter is not available we can look for other facility to book
I write through FB chat to Clementi Sportd hall couple of months before until today no answer

I believe you have seen and read the recently news on Badminton Court
Booking issues and challenges in getting court booked for our own game with
our own friends. For me, the booking challenges are NOT new issues (although
selling the court is really news to me and also shocking to know, how some have
managed to sell the courts!!!!!). I thought through, as I one of the regular
ActiveSG Sports Facility User (Badminton) and Badminton is my PASSION.
Having such a passion to the game, I invested, encouraged my friends to play
Badminton, donated racquets etc., Also keep trying to reach out ActiveSG /
MCCY and other known associations/organizations contacts in resolving the
issues and to make the system to work for all equally. All my requests so far, did
not give desired results. So writing a proposal as a last resort to get the situation
better.
Please find attached proposal for your perusal and I strongly believe that you will
consider the proposal and respond accordingly. With available time and
resources I have, the proposal is prepared, it may not be perfect. I believe your
prestigeous organizations know-how, expertise, resources, my initial proposal

will be requested at exactly 7am (system time in SGT) and without solving it there is no

Hi Azimah

Under 11 Boys single will not show if it has reached maximum capacity.

Apologies, understand that the NRIC I provided is a U11 Boys and thus they cant see now becoz category is currently full.

But what had happened previously is that the father of this U11 boy had tried to register but he couldn’t see the singles category also when he tried to
register.

The registration was just open at then and we are 100% sure that registration is not full.

I have another NRIC – the daughter of the same father, to seek your assistance to check on: T1420020C

Hi Sir/Mdm,

We have encountered issues by our participants where they are unable to see the singles category for the badminton competition that we are organising
on 16-17 March.

Event: Active School Holiday Badminton Smash

Category issue: U9, U11 boy and girl Singles

We have since directed many participants facing this issue to sign up at Pasir Ris Sport Centre through on site POS registration.

Below is one of the kid’s account that is facing this issue for your checking:

NRIC of a 11 year old kid: T1026168B

Attached is the picture of the child’s account which shows that they cant see the U11 singles category even though they are eligible.

ActiveSG will also be using this system for the upcoming Pesta Sukan Registration and thus we will need to seek help to look into this issue.

Hi,

Thank you for writing to ActiveSG Technical HelpDesk.

Please update the ActiveSG Android mobile app from the Google Play Store to the latest Version.
Upon accessing the Step Challenge, if prompted to allow ActiveSG access to Google Fit data,
please tap “OK” and choose your Google account.

The chosen Google account must match that in use in Google Fit. Within Google Fit Settings, under
“Google Fit Data”, “Activity detection” and “High accuracy mode” must be switched on, and
ActiveSG must be listed inside “Apps connected”.

Optional, but please also try this step if the above does not work:
Settings -> Apps (or Installed Apps) -> ActiveSG -> Clear Cache & Clear Data
Uninstall and reinstall ActiveSG

If there is a significant discrepancy with your step count, please submit a screenshot of your daily
step count from the Health app, starting from the day you joined Step Challenge, along with a
screenshot of your data sources (Health Data -> Activity -> Steps -> Data Sources & Access).

Hi Christina,

name already reflected?
Also be informed that your child is already above 12 years old, his need to visit any of the nearest
ActiveSG facilities to update his account type from Supplementary to individual account. He may also
get assistance to update his account with his own mobile number and email address.
Hope this clarifies.

Hi
I had purchased a gym pass on behalf of my son Jerald Ong using the ActiveSG
app. The account used during to booking was his name but when I secure the
booking, I noticed the receipt was showing my name.
Please assist to check the booking reservation and advice the next steps as this is
the 2nd incidents that occured to us. The last one he was rejected entry due to
incorrect name shown on the reciept as we wasn’t aware we needed to change the
account. This time, we had changed the account but the receipt still showing in my
name.

Hi Azimah,

Zul has contacted me that he cannot see my certificates and updated First Aid, CPR AED Certificates on my service provider page even though
i have updated them .

He thinks that it might be the difference in my name on the certificates and my NRIC.
My Nric name is Rasidah Binte Mohamad Khalid Mrs Rasidah Caudal and the name on the certificates is Rasidah Caudal.

Could you please help me with this? I have been teaching at Activesg sport Centres for many years and I did not know that I have been having
this problem until i wanted to add a new program.

Is there someone that I could see to settle this?

I really would like to start the new program in March. I still could not add any job to my page .

Thank you.

"Hi All,
This case needs investigation
- Issue: Unable to book 2 different stages in the same assessment reference.
- Platform: MMS, production
- Raised by: Michelle Verma, Swimsafer coach
- How to get the problem again?
Michelle Verma is unable to book 2 different stages in the same assessment reference.
She wants to do 2 different stages in one assessment
If she were to separate the stages, she doesn't have enough students, because 1 assessment needs min. 5 pax
Can the assessor create a single assessment with 2 different stages?
Please see email thread for more info, thank you.

Michelle Verma's first email:
1. Unable to book 2 cross levels in the same assessment reference.
2. if i try to book them separately, it indicated there needs to be a min of 5pax. Previously it was 3 pax. The 5 pax rule
applies for a conjoined 2 stage (i.e 6 S1 and 1 S2). This is what I am trying to do.

Thanks and Best Regards,
Elizabeth

Dear All,
These are the bookings I am trying to create with number of pax to clarify it. Please do let me know if I could send the CSV file manually and safely as they contain NRIC
number of the kids. I would really need an assessor for these assessments.

S3 Queenstown (3 pax) and S4 Queenstown (5pax) 9/4 (Tues) 5-6pm - (Have booked S4 and examiner appointed is Goh Hock Lye. Unable to add the S3 candidates,

Last email sent was 5 in 2 stage by Matthew Tan. Anyways. I do have more than 6 in
2 stages. That's not the issue. The issue is booking it together and not being able to
filter it.

Summary of issue for now that SportSG is informed of
1. Problem with S1 (6pax) and S2 ( 1pax) on 15/3 5.30-6.30pm at Landridge Condo.
Can’t combine. Tried separate. Error is min 5 pax
2. Problem with S5 (6pax) and S6 ( 1 pax) on 15/3 5.30-6.30pm at Landridge Condo.
Can’t combine. Tried separate. Error is min 5 pax
3. Problem with S1 (3pax) and S2(3 pax) on 12/3 Friday 5-6pm at Queenstown. Error
is min 5 pax and cant combine.
4. Problem combining S3 (3 pax) with S4 (booked) at Queenstown 9/3 on Tuesday
5-6pm . Need to have these two combined. This was advised initially by IAPPS
5. They couldn’t detect Queenstown Swim Complex in Venue. I had to put it under
others.

Hi Michelle,
You may book 2 stage in 1 assessment with the minimum of 6 pax.
Not sure there is any changes to the booking criteria or policies. The last information sent to us dated
August 2019 - Refer below UPDATES ON SWIMSAFER SERVICE PROVIDER PORTAL AND PDPA
RULING.
Have loop +Jayme_JACOB@sport.gov.sg in for advice if there were any changes made since the last
announcement.
Dear SwimSafer Service Providers, Instructors & Assessors,
Since the launch of SwimSafer 2.0 portal in 2018, we have received numerous feedback on user interface and system related issues.
With your valuable feedback, we have reviewed and will introduce these major updates to meet the system gaps, and to improve transparency and
accountability.
This is the 1st phase of system updates/changes, Phase 2 is currently on-going, this will be updated to all in due course.
The key changes/updates are as listed below.
Please be informed that the key changes/updates will be implemented with effect dated on the 29 August 2019.
KEY CHANGES LISTING
1. There is now a minimum booking of 6 participants for all swimsafer
assessment. (*This rule does not applies to MOE School Programme).
2. The “Assessment End Time” will be removed at the “Create Assessment
page” and all assessments will be fixed at 1 hour duration.
3. The grouping combinations allowed for each assessment are as shown:
Stage Min Participants Total Students
allowed per
grouping

Assessors

Stage 1 & 2 6 30 students 1
Stage 3 & 4 6 20 students 1
Stage 5 & 6 6 10 students 1
4. The “Cheque” payment mode will be removed. Please submit all your
outstanding cheque payment to Sport Singapore, if any, asap (Please refer to the

end of the email for the steps to make payment to us). All swimsafer assessment
payment will be via “Credit/Debit Card” payment mode.
5. All swimsafer assessments successfully booked from 12 midnight to
8pm will only be published in the system for assessor bidding at 10pm.
6. The assessment job email notifications to all assessors will be removed.
7. Assessors are only allowed to bid for 1 assessment job for every 1 hour.
Example 1:
If you have bided for 9am assessment job at Bukit Batok Swimming Complex.
You will not be able to bid for other assessments from 9am to 10am. You can only
bid for assessment with start time before 9am or after 10am onwards.
Example 2:
If you have bided for 10.15am assessment job at Queenstown Swimming Complex.
You will not be able to bid for other assessments with the similar start time from
10.15am to 11.15am. You can only bid for assessment with start time before
10.15am or after 11.15am onwards.
Hope this clarifies.

Thank you.

Please see as attached.
The min for 1&2 is 5 pax.
Is there anyone who can hasten this up. I have been 4 days delayed and i cant afford to push the
assessment dates back. If there is any other temporial alternative i.e sending the CSV files manually to
the swimsafer team for you guys to do the bookings back end?
Please at least give me a call.

Hi Alex,

Per the SwimSafer booking system, bookings can only be made 2 weeks prior to the date of the test. This is to prevent double bookings.

As such, the system was not letting you make a booking as you were trying to make one for the 13th of March on the 3rd of March.

Do schedule for a later date that the system will allow.

Thank you.
Kind Regards,
Jayme Jacob

Yes we know. We also know roughly the timing of captcha if it is slow or fast. Even we get in fast c1 3-5pm is taken already in bowen every saturday which is friday booking.
As you have take action on the previous issue in script booking. You have encourage the public to report. We just notice that it is weeks that c1 is always taken fast even thought we get in fast enough.
We hope you can just look into this and investigate if the booking is really human speed.
Thanks.

Hi,
Please be inform that booking is first come first serve and we do not have any control or allow reservation for individual booking. We have implemented Captcha our both App and Web platform during the peak hour at 7am ,12pm and 1pm.
With the CAPTCHA step, we are enhancing our autosystem to better serve all our members.
It is aimed at helping to prevent the use of automated software, which will mean that all members making any booking transactions on both the/   ActiveSG website and mobile app will have an equal chance.
Hope this clarifies.
Thank you.

Screenshot that c1 3-5 pm is booked already? I cannot capture it since we are booking 3-5 pm. But every week it is red already and not available.
Please help to check if this is prebooked or maybe using some script.
Thanks.
